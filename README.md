### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm David Legarre, a Mathematical Engineer specialized in Data Science from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). My work revolves around Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision, but I also explore side projects in different areas of tech.

Now I'm focused on fullstack development mainly in JavaScript so that I can understand better how most apps work and practicing other progamming languages.

What You'll Find Here
This GitHub serves as a collection of my AI and data-driven projects, including:

* Machine Learning Models for real-world applications
* Computer Vision Projects leveraging deep learning
* MLOps & Data Pipelines for scalable AI solutions
* Full-Stack Experiments to deepen my understanding of application development

Currently, Iâ€™m enhancing my skills in JavaScript and full-stack development to gain a deeper perspective on how AI integrates into real-world applications.
