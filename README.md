### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is David Legarre and I'm a Mathematical Engineer on Data Science by the UPF university. 
In this GitHub profile is were I store all the projects I'm working I focus mostly on AI and Computer Vision although there are many other side projects I may try from time to time.

Now I'm focused on fullstack development mainly in JavaScript so that I can understand better how most apps work and practicing other progamming languages.
